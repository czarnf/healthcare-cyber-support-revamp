    - Implement machine learning models to detect unusual network behavior
    - Provide explainable AI insights for detected anomalies

15. Blockchain for audit trails:
    - Implement a blockchain-based system for immutable security event logging
    - Use smart contracts for automated compliance checks and reporting

16. Virtual Security Operations Center (vSOC):
    - Create a centralized dashboard for security operations
    - Implement automated triage and escalation procedures

17. Third-party risk management:
    - Develop a system for assessing and monitoring the security posture of third-party vendors
    - Implement automated risk scoring and alerting for vendor-related threats

18. Threat hunting tools:
    - Create interfaces for advanced threat hunting across the network
    - Implement visualization tools for complex data analysis in threat hunting

19. Incident simulation and tabletop exercises:
    - Develop a module for creating and running cybersecurity incident simulations
    - Include features for scheduling, participating in, and reviewing tabletop exercises

20. Integration with medical devices:
    - Implement specialized monitoring for connected medical devices
    - Develop security protocols specific to different types of medical equipment

## Compatibility Considerations

When implementing any of these improvements, refer to the changes.md file to ensure compatibility with previous updates. Key points to consider:

1. Maintain the current UI design language and color scheme
2. Ensure new features work seamlessly in both light and dark modes
3. Integrate new functionality into the existing dashboard layout
4. Use consistent loading states and error handling across new features
5. Extend the current authentication system when implementing new user roles or permissions
6. Ensure any new data visualization components are consistent with the current chart styles
7. Maintain responsiveness across all device sizes for new features
8. Use the established component library (shadcn/ui) for new UI elements
9. Follow the current project structure and file naming conventions
10. Update the changes.md file with any new implementations or modifications

By adhering to these considerations, we can ensure that new functionality improvements integrate smoothly with the existing application architecture and design.
